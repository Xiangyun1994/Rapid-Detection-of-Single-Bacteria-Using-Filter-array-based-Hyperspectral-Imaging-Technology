# Rapid Detection of Single Bacteria Using Filter-array-based Hyperspectral Imaging Technology
code: Rapid and accurate detection of bacterial pathogens is crucial for preventing widespread public health crises, particularly in the food industry. Traditional methods are often slow and require extensive labeling, which hampers timely responses to potential threats. In response, we introduce a groundbreaking approach using filter-array-based hyperspectral imaging technology, enhanced by a super-resolution demosaicking technique. This innovative technology streamlines the detection process and significantly enhances the resolution of mosaic hyperspectral imaging. By utilizing a snapshot hyperspectral camera with a 15 ms integration time, it facilitates the identification of bacteria at the single-cell level without requiring chemical labels. The integration of a 3D convolutional neural network optimizes the recognition of pathogenic bacteria, achieving an impressive accuracy of 91.7%. Our approach dramatically improves the efficiency and effectiveness of bacterial detection, providing a promising solution for critical applications in public health and the food industry.
